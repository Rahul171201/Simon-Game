# Simon-Game
A JavaScript based popular SIMON GAME. The user presses any key to start. Once the game started, there is a blink over any of the 4 colored squares randomly. The player needs to remember the color of the square at each level and click all the squares from the start till that level in the same order. For example lets say there is blink on the square colored "RED" in the first level. So the player clicks red and advances to level 2. There is now a blink on the yellow square suppose. So now the player needs to click on "RED" first, then "YELLOW" to be able to advance to the next level 3 and so on. The objective of the game is to reach your maximum highest level.

# Overview
This is the game start screen. Any player who comes in first sees this screen. When a player taps on any key on their keyboard the game starts from level 1.

# Future Extension
The game can be extended to further features:
* The game can be made into different versions of easy, medium and hard depending upon the number of colored squares for each level or the entire game.
* The game can be extended to support physically challenged people who cant type in or click from the keyboard by implementing voice enabled gaming interface where the game proceeds with the help of speech recognition.
* The game designs may be changed to have better looking UI.
